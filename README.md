## Script
Alternate history where the cuban missile crisis ended in nuclear war, with humanity wiped out, animals had to fend for themselves.

For some reason they all became intelligent at once (scientists created virus to be released that made animals intelligent). And they are now faced with (for the first time), a choice.
